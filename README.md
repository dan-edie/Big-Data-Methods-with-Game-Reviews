# big-data-challenge

This project was our introduction to using Big Data techniques to examine large datasets on the cloud.

Unfortunately, an error occurred when trying to download the data into the PostgreSQL tables, so the final analysis was not performed.
The error has no clear solution, and both instructors and TAs for the bootcamp were unable to help find a solution. This is just another
learning lesson, though: sometimes, an error can come along that requires differeing solutions. This was a voluntary project, and with
the third project in full swing, I did not have time to focus on finding solutions.

Otherwise, this gave me experience using Google Colab to work with a large set of data, and gave me a refresher in SQL code.

Next steps: Continue working on this project and see if I can get AWS to connect to a PostgreSQL server to finish the project.
